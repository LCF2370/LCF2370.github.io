				<h1>Metal</h1>

				<p>Metal storage sheds offer several advantages that make them a popular choice for homeowners and businesses:</p>
				<ul class="tablet-desktop">
					<li><span class="highlight">Durability:</span> Metal sheds are known for their longevity. They can withstand harsh weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, and strong winds. Unlike wood, they are not prone to rotting, warping, or insect damage.</li>				
					<li><span class="highlight">Low Maintenance:</span> Metal sheds require minimal maintenance compared to their wooden counterparts. They don't need to be painted or treated regularly, and they are not susceptible to issues like termites or mold.</li>					
					<li><span class="highlight">Security</span>: Metal sheds are sturdy and provide a higher level of security compared to plastic or fabric storage solutions. They are harder to break into, providing a secure space for valuable items.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Fire Resistance:</span> Metal is non-combustible, which means it's less likely to catch fire in the event of a nearby fire or other accidents.</li>

				<h1>Vinyl/Plastic</h1>
				<img src="images/vinyl-sheds.jpg" alt="Storage sheds made with vinyl or plastic materials in backyard settings." class="round">
				<p>Vinyl storage sheds offer several advantages that make them a popular choice for homeowners and businesses:</p>
				<ul class="tablet-desktop">				
					<li><span class="highlight">Low Maintenance:</span> Vinyl sheds are virtually maintenance-free. They don't require painting, staining, or sealing like wooden sheds. They are resistant to rot, rust, and pests, making them a hassle-free storage solution.</li>			
					<li><span class="highlight">Durable and Long-Lasting:</span> Vinyl is a strong and durable material that can withstand various weather conditions, including rain, snow, and strong winds. It won't warp, crack, or fade over time.</li>					
					<li><span class="highlight">Resistant to Termites and Insects:</span> Unlike wood, vinyl is not susceptible to termite infestations or damage from other pests. This makes it an excellent choice for areas where pests are a concern.</li>

				<h1>Wood</h1>
				<img src="images/wood-sheds.jpg" alt="Storage sheds made with wood materials in backyard settings." class="round">
				<p>Wood storage sheds offer several advantages that make them a popular choice for many homeowners:</p>
				<ul class="tablet-desktop">				
					<li><span class="highlight">Sturdiness and Durability:</span> When properly constructed and maintained, wood sheds can be highly durable. They are able to withstand various weather conditions, including rain, snow, and wind.</li>					
					<li><span class="highlight">Insulation and Temperature Regulation:</span> Wood has natural insulating properties, which can help regulate the temperature inside the shed. This makes it a more comfortable environment for working or spending time in during different seasons.</li>					
					<li><span class="highlight">Repairability:</span> In the event of damage, wood can be repaired or replaced more easily compared to materials like metal or vinyl. This can extend the lifespan of the shed.</li>
